    ## TODO aeroはlineにして、min_obstacle_distを大きくしている
    type: polygon ## Specify the robot footprint model type used for optimization. Different types are "point", "circular", "line", "two_circles" and "polygon." The type of the model significantly influences the required computation time.
    vertices: [[ 0.1,  0.25], [-0.1,  0.25], [-0.1, -0.25], [ 0.1, -0.25]] ## This parameter is only relevant for type "polygon". It contains the list of polygon vertices (2d coordinates each). The polygon is always closed: do not repeat the first vertex at the end. ## 最適化時にはmapのfootprintは無視され、代わりにこちらが用いられる. ちょっと小さくして、代わりにmin_obstacle_distを大きくしたほうがソフト制約になって勾配が消失せず安定する
  is_footprint_dynamic: true ## If true, updates the footprint before checking trajectory feasibility

  xy_goal_tolerance: 0.20 ## Allowed final euclidean distance to the goal position in meters
  yaw_goal_tolerance: 0.2 ## Allowed final orientation error in radians
  free_goal_vel: true ## Remove the goal velocity constraint such that the robot can arrive at the goal with maximum speed

  dt_ref: 1.1 ## Desired temporal resolution of the trajectory (the trajectory is not fixed to dt_ref since the temporal resolution is part of the optimization, but the trajectory will be resized between iterations if dt_ref +-dt_hysteresis is violated. # hrpsysは一歩おきにしか更新できないので一歩の時間と同じにしておく
  dt_hysteresis: 0.1 ## Hysteresis for automatic resizing depending on the current temporal resolution, usually approx. 10% of dt_ref is recommended
  min_samples: 3 ## Minimum number of samples (should be always greater than 2)
  global_plan_overwrite_orientation: true ## Overwrite orientation of local subgoals provided by the global planner (since they often provide only a 2D path)
  global_plan_viapoint_sep: 0.4 ## If positive, via-points are extrected from the global plan (path-following mode). The value determines the resolution of the reference path (min. separation between each two consecutive via-points along the global plan, if negative: disabled). Refer to parameter weight_viapoint for adjusting the intensity. (default -0.1) ## グローバルプランの結果を利用したほうが安定する
  max_global_plan_lookahead_dist: 1.0 ## Specify the maximum length (cumulative Euclidean distances) of the subset of the global plan taken into account for optimization. The actual length is than determined by the logical conjunction of the local costmap size and this maximum bound. Set to zero or negative in order to deactivate this limitation. ## 遠くまで予見すると不安定になる
  force_reinit_new_goal_dist: 0.5 ## Reinitialize the trajectory if a previous goal is updated with a separation of more than the specified value in meters (skip hot-starting)
  feasibility_check_no_poses: 4 ## Specify up to which pose on the predicted plan the feasibility should be checked each sampling interval.
  publish_feedback: false ## Publish planner feedback containing the full trajectory and a list of active obstacles (should be enabled only for evaluation or debugging). See list of publishers above.

  allow_init_with_backwards_motion: false ## If true, underlying trajectories might be initialized with backwards motions in case the goal is behind the start within the local costmap (this is only recommended if the robot is equipped with rear sensors).
  exact_arc_length: false ## If true, the planner uses the exact arc length in velocity, acceleration and turning rate computations (-> increased cpu time), otherwise the Euclidean approximation is used. ## hrpsysの中のgo-velocityはexectではない(false).
  shrink_horizon_min_duration: 3.0 ## Specify minimum duration for the reduced horizon in case an infeasible trajectory is detected (refer to parameter shrink_horizon_backup in order to activate the reduced horizon mode).

  include_costmap_obstacles: True ## Specify if obstacles of the local costmap should be taken into account. Each cell that is marked as obstacle is considered as a point-obstacle. Therefore do not choose a very small resolution of the costmap since it increases computation time. In future releases this circumstance is going to be addressed as well as providing an additional api for dynamic obstacles.
  costmap_obstacles_behind_robot_dist: 2.0 ## Limit the occupied local costmap obstacles taken into account for planning behind the robot (specify distance in meters).
  obstacle_poses_affected: 10 ## Each obstacle position is attached to the closest pose on the trajectory in order to keep a distance. Additional neighbors can be taken into account as well. Note, this parameter might be removed in future versions, since the the obstacle association strategy has been modified in kinetic+. Refer to the parameter description of legacy_obstacle_association.
  inflation_dist: 0.70 ## Buffer zone around obstacles with non-zero penalty costs (should be larger than min_obstacle_dist in order to take effect). Also refer to the weight weight_inflation. ## mapのinflationは使われないことに注意
  include_dynamic_obstacles: false ## If this parameter is set to true, the motion of obstacles with non-zero velocity (provided via user-supplied obstacles on topic ~/obstacles or obtained from the costmap_converter) is predicted and considered during optimization via a constant velocity model. New
  obstacle_association_force_inclusion_factor: 2.0 ## The non-legacy obstacle association strategy tries to connect only relevant obstacles with the discretized trajectory during optimization. But all obstacles within a specifed distance are forced to be included (as a multiple of min_obstacle_dist). E.g. choose 2.0 in order toenforce the consideration obstacles within a radius of 2.0*min_obstacle_dist.
  obstacle_association_cutoff_factor: 5.0 ## See obstacle_association_force_inclusion_factor, but beyond a multiple of [value]*min_obstacle_dist all obstacles are ignored during optimization. Parameter obstacle_association_force_inclusion_factor is processed first.
  costmap_converter_plugin: "" ## Define plugin name in order to convert costmap cells to points/lines/polygons. Set an empty string to disable the conversion such that all cells are treated as point-obstacles. ## 障害物を見落とす恐れがあるので使用しないほうがいい
  costmap_converter_spin_thread: True ## If set to true, the costmap converter invokes its callback queue in a different thread.
  costmap_converter_rate: 2 ## rate that defines how often the costmap_converter plugin processes the current costmap (the value should not be much higher than the costmap update rate) [in Hz]. ## control frequencyと同じにしておく. 

# Optimization
  no_inner_iterations: 5 ## Number of actual solver iterations called in each outerloop iteration. See param no_outer_iterations.
  no_outer_iterations: 4 ## Each outerloop iteration automatically resizes the trajectory according to the desired temporal resolution dt_ref and invokes the internal optimizer (that performs no_inner_iterations). The total number of solver iterations in each planning cycle is therefore the product of both values.
  penalty_epsilon: 0.01 ## Add a small safety margin to penalty functions for hard-constraint approximations
  weight_max_vel_x: 2 ## Optimization weight for satisfying the maximum allowed translational velocity
  weight_max_vel_y: 2
  weight_max_vel_theta: 1 ## Optimization weight for satisfying the maximum allowed angular velocity
  weight_acc_lim_x: 1 ## Optimization weight for satisfying the maximum allowed translational acceleration
  weight_acc_lim_y: 1
  weight_acc_lim_theta: 1 ## Optimization weight for satisfying the maximum allowed angular acceleration
  weight_kinematics_nh: 1 ## Optimization weight for satisfying the non-holonomic kinematics (this parameter must be high since the kinematics equation constitutes an equality constraint, even a value of 1000 does not imply a bad matrix condition due to small 'raw' cost values in comparison to other costs). ## 横方向へ動けるので小さく. が、カメラは前方にしか無いので小さすぎるのも良くない(default 1000)
  weight_kinematics_forward_drive: 100 ## Optimization weight for forcing the robot to choose only forward directions (positive transl. velocities). A small weight (e.g. 1.0) still allows driving backwards. A value around 1000 almost prevents backward driving (but cannot be guaranteed). ## カメラは前方にしか無いので大きく (default 1)
  weight_kinematics_turning_radius: 0.0 ## Optimization weight for enforcing a minimum turning radius (only for carlike robots).
  weight_optimaltime: 1 ## Optimization weight for contracting the trajectory w.r.t transition/execution time
  weight_obstacle: 50 ## Optimization weight for keeping a minimum distance from obstacles (default 50)
  weight_viapoint: 1.0 ## Optimization weight for minimzing the distance to via-points (resp. reference path)
  weight_inflation: 0.1 ## Optimization weight for the inflation penalty (should be small).
  weight_adapt_factor: 2.0 ## Some special weights (currently weight_obstacle) are repeatedly scaled by this factor in each outer TEB iteration (weight_new = weight_old*factor). Increasing weights iteratively instead of setting a huge value a-priori leads to better numerical conditions of the underlying optimization problem. (default 2.0)

# Homotopy Class Planner
  enable_homotopy_class_planning: false ## Activate parallel planning in distinctive topologies (requires much more CPU resources, since multiple trajectories are optimized at once)
  enable_multithreading: true ## Activate multiple threading in order to plan each trajectory in a different thread
  max_number_classes: 2 ## Specify the maximum number of distinctive trajectories taken into account (limits computational effort)
  selection_cost_hysteresis: 1.0 ## Specify how much trajectory cost must a new candidate have w.r.t. a previously selected trajectory in order to be selected (selection if new_cost < old_cost*factor).
  selection_obst_cost_scale: 100.0 ## Extra scaling of obstacle cost terms just for selecting the 'best' candidate.
  selection_viapoint_cost_scale: 1.0 ## Extra scaling of via-point cost terms just for selecting the 'best' candidate
  selection_alternative_time_cost: false ## If true, time cost (sum of squared time differences) is replaced by the total transition time (sum of time differences).
  roadmap_graph_no_samples: 15 ## Specify the number of samples generated for creating the roadmap graph
  roadmap_graph_area_width: 5 ## Random keypoints/waypoints are sampled in a rectangular region between start and goal. Specify the width of that region in meters. ## 部屋の中を移動するだけの場合は大きすぎるか???
  h_signature_prescaler: 0.5 ## Scale internal parameter (H-signature) that is used to distinguish between homotopy classes. Warning: reduce this parameter only, if you observe problems with too many obstacles in the local cost map, do not choose it extremly low, otherwise obstacles cannot be distinguished from each other (0.2<value<=1).
  h_signature_threshold: 0.1 ## Two H-signatures are assumed to be equal, if both the difference of real parts and complex parts are below the specified threshold.
  obstacle_heading_threshold: 0.45 ## Specify the value of the scalar product between obstacle heading and goal heading in order to take them (obstacles) into account for exploration.
  visualize_hc_graph: false ## Visualize the graph that is created for exploring distinctive trajectories (check marker message in rviz)
  viapoints_all_candidates: true ## If true, all trajectories of different topologies are attached to the set of via-points, otherwise only the trajectory sharing the same topology as the initial/global plan is connected with them (no effect on test_optim_node).
  switching_blocking_period: 0.0 ## Specify a time duration in seconds that needs to be expired before a switch to a new equivalence class is allowed.
